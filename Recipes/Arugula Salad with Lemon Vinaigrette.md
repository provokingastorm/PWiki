- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- ½ tablespoon tamari
- 6 cups arugula
- [Lemon vinaigrette](https://www.loveandlemons.com/lemon-vinaigrette/), for drizzling
- ¼ cup shaved Parmesan or pecorino

### Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 400°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
    
- Place the almonds on the first sheet and the grapes on the second. Drizzle the almonds and grapes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss the almonds with the tamari and roast for 7 to 10 minutes, or until dark and toasty. Roast the grapes for 7 to 15 minutes, until they’re soft and just starting to burst. The timing will depend on the size of the grapes.
    
- Place the arugula in a large shallow bowl and toss with drizzles of the vinaigrette. Top with the almonds, grapes, and Parmesan. Season to taste and serve.
