- **Edit: If you can't get your controller to work, check this extra note from lightsup55.**  
    
    Only the newer Xbox One controllers support Bluetooth. See the image in the support article below to see how you can tell if your controller supports Bluetooth.  
    [https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/accesso...](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/accessories/connect-and-troubleshoot-xbox-one-bluetooth-issues)  
      
    In short, the following Xbox wireless controllers support Bluetooth:  
    - model 1708 Xbox One wireless controller with a Micro-B connector (this is the second revision that has a noticeable difference with the plastic around the Xbox button when compared to the earlier revisions)  
    - all Xbox wireless controllers with a USB-C connector
    
      
      
    This game is one of the most complicated to complete (whilst still being possible) as of right now, simply because it requires a lot of expensive equipment, and it requires you to do some very specific things to get it to work.  
      
    _This guide is on how to obtain the game and sign in. Not on the actual achievements. You can find information on how to do the achievements in the walkthrough for this game._  
      
    I would like to thank [lightsup55](https://www.trueachievements.com/gamer/lightsup55) for steering me in the right direction and also for providing the download links.  
      
    Hopefully, with this comprehensive and full guide, I can help everyone who wants to complete this game be able to accomplish it. I spent a few hours on it this afternoon, and believe I've found a certain way, as of right now, for it to work.  
      
    What you'll need,  
      
    1.Officially supported Samsung Gear VR phone. This can cost up to $250, depending on which model you get. If you get the cheapest one, it will be significantly lower. I got the Samsung Galaxy S9+  
    Here's the list off officially supported phones. If you do not have one, there's no way you will be able to play this game.  
    
    [*** Spoiler - click to reveal ***](https://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=1344545#)
    
      
      
    2. Gear VR headset that is compatible with your specific phone.  
    Please use this website: [https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/which-gala...](https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/which-galaxy-smartphones-are-compatible-with-which-gear-vrs/)  
      
    to find the model number for which headset you need to buy, based on which phone you have purchased. Depending on which headset you need to get, this could cost from $30-$70. (supplies are exhausting, especially if you want a new one) Since I had the Samsung Galaxy S9+, I needed to get the Gear VR SM-R325.  
      
    This is now a **necessary** step. You used to be able to bypass owning one of these, by doing a couple workarounds. However, this is no longer possible, simply because now, the only way to get the Gear VR software (and have it work correctly) is to install it directly from the headset itself.  
      
    3. Bluetooth Controller.  
    A Bluetooth controller is required to play the game. However, an Xbox One wireless controller will work, and I'm assuming almost everyone on this website has one.  
      
    4. Oculus account with Minecraft game owned (??)  
    Unfortunately, Minecraft Gear VR was delisted from the Oculus store, meaning that you can no longer purchase it. This means, the only way you can get this now is borrowing a friend/random person's account with the game.  
      
    However, this **may not** be required, as we're going to install an APK of an older version of the game, anyway. I'm just unsure if you need to have the license for any security checks upon signing in or launching the game.  
    Please let me know if you can get this to work without owning the game and I'll update the guide.  
      
      
    5. Second Android device/Windows PC with Bluestacks  
    There's two co-op achievements in the game, and you must be playing with another person (or yourself) on another device running the same version of the game to get these two achievements. We'll discuss what version you need to install later, just make sure you have the device for preparation.  
      
    Ok, now you have everything needed to complete this game.  
    Now it's time to setup the game and get you signed in.  
      
    First, get your Gear VR setup and working correctly.  
    Once it's setup, do not install Minecraft from the Oculus store. On your phone, you need to disable auto-updates on the Google Play Store and also the Oculus app. If you do not do this, the apps you are about to install will immediately update to their latest versions which will make it impossible to sign in to the game.  
      
    Go to this link: (Again, thanks to [lightsup55](https://www.trueachievements.com/gamer/lightsup55) for providing all links) [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ixehlhn7802olfy/AAA4cTfIOU-T....apk](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ixehlhn7802olfy/AAA4cTfIOU-TzDUCv79RfV8ga?dl=0&preview=com-mojang-minecraftvr-941160102-52279540-c985b6a252e289b0e3599b2d5f233872.apk)  
    and install it. This is Minecraft Gear VR version 1.16.1.02 which is the only version that will work. You must use this version or it will not work. You will be unable to sign in with the latest version of the game, which is 1.16.40  
      
    Then, you'll need to install this: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ixehlhn7802olfy/AAA4cTfIOU-TzDUCv...](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ixehlhn7802olfy/AAA4cTfIOU-TzDUCv79RfV8ga?dl=0) (Click on the second option. (Microsoft Xbox One Smartglass))  
      
    This is Xbox app version 1805.0814.0658 . you MUST use this version. Some people said that you could use other versions, but as of right now, this is the ONLY Xbox app version that works. This is the last version of the Xbox app before they dropped support for Gear VR. The Minecraft version that we installed will simply sign in **directly** from this Xbox app, and will not redirect you to a browser to sign in, which was the issue that everybody was having.  
      
    This Xbox app will automatically appear in the Gear VR library without the need to install it through Oculus.  
      
    Next, you'll need to pair your controller. Go to your Bluetooth settings in your phone, enter pairing mode on the controller by holding the top button for three seconds, and then pair it to your phone.  
      
    Now, you should have both the correct version of the game and also the correct Xbox app. Now it's as simple as starting the game and signing in. Upon starting the game, I did not choose to sign in right away. I pressed B to back out of the initial prompt, and then on the title screen, I pressed the 'Sign in' button on the left side of the menu. Once I pressed this, about 10 seconds later, I was signed in, directly from the Xbox app. I was not redirected to a browser, and I did not even have to remove my phone from the headset.  
      
    Now that you're signed in, you're pretty much good to go. On your other Android device, you'll need to install this version of Minecraft: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ixehlhn7802olfy/AAA4cTfIOU-TzDUCv...](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ixehlhn7802olfy/AAA4cTfIOU-TzDUCv79RfV8ga?dl=0)  
    (Click Minecraft Android and download the file in that folder)  
      
    to be able to join your main account in the game. If you use the latest version from the Google Play store, you'll be unable to join your Gear VR account since it's using an older version.  
      
    That's pretty much it. You can find information on actually getting the achievements elsewhere. This was just a guide to get you started and signed in which is very complicated on this game.  
      
    I hope this helped. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if any information appears to be incorrect. I'll try to help to the best of my abilities. I'm 99% sure this will work on every compatible device, but there could also be other factors that we do not fully understand affecting whether or not we can sign in.  
      
    Good luck! As far as I can tell, this is the only VR game in the world that has Xbox achievements.
