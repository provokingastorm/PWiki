I'm throwing it out in this thread since it's germane but I finally wrote up a slightly easy to follow guide for getting started with a BBB.

What this does for you:  
Can control guitar/drums/etc and have them actually register as the right thing on the xbox  
Can make a regular controller act like a guitar/drums  
Can send button presses from my autoGH program to the xbox  
  
What does this doesn't do for you:  
This doesn't let you make combos that you can trigger at the press of a button.  
This doesn't let you have complex internal logic in a script. It's basically just a big list of what buttons to press at what times.  
  
I've heard that the titan two will pass through the correct device ID for drums/guitars/etc but don't have one myself. If that is true, it would be a hell of a lot easier. I don't think I have autogh set up for it, but assuming I can interface with it the same way as CM/CZ/T1, it should only take about 10-15 minutes for me to make the necessary changes.
