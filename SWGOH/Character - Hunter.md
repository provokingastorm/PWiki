[[Squad Notes - Bad Batch]]

## Gameplay Notes

 - When with #Echo, use the "Finish What We Started" ability on him so he can apply #BuffImmunity and #Daze on enemies to prevent them from recovering. 

## Mod Notes

 - Wants a combination of offense and potency. Emphasis on offense.
 - His kit does give him bonus potency. 
 - The offense stat boosts improve the true damage he does, similar to [[Character - Omega|Omega]].
