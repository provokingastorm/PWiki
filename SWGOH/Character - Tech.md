## Common Squads

[[Squad Notes - Bad Batch]]

## Gameplay Notes

 - When Echo uses his "Never Ending Doubt" ability to inflict irresistible #Daze and #HealingImmunity, Tech should immediately stun all the enemies with his "Brilliant Idea" ability. This means, Tech will need to be closer in speed to Echo. The "Clone Interpreter" zeta helps make it a reality. 

## Mod Notes

 - Combination of speed with potency.
 - Needs to be close in speed to [[Character - Echo|Echo]] to pull off their ability combination.
 - Even though, Tech gets potency from his kit, landing the stun is so important that it's worth investing in some extra potency.

## Recommended Zetas

1. Clone Interpreter - Useful for the speed increase in a Bad Batch squad when the opponent doesn't apply a lot of buffs on themselves
