The following lists are recommended squads to use in Grand Arena Championship, both 5v5 and 3v3, on offense and on defense.
## 5v5 Grand Arena

### Offense
[[Squad Notes - Admiral Raddus#Squad 1 - AdRad|Standard AdRad squad]]
 - Easily countered by Bad Batch, which doesn't make it a great defensive team.
 - On offense, the AI will often mistakenly target [[Character - Jyn Erso|Jyn Erso]] instead of [[Character - Admiral Raddus|Admiral Raddus]], which improves the chance of victory.

### Defense


## 3v3 Grand Arena

### Offense
[[Squad Notes - Admiral Raddus#Squad 2 - Standard AdRad 3v3 Squad|Standard AdRad 3v3 squad]]

### Defense
