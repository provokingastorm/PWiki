## Gameplay Notes

 - Prioritize using the "One Step Ahead" ability on [[Character - Hunter|Hunter]] to reduce the turn meter of an enemy that wasn't stunned by Tech's "Brilliant Idea" ability. Alternatively, use Wrecker's "Wrecking Ball" ability to apply a stun to any enemy that avoided Tech's stun.

## Mod Notes

 - Speed, speed, speed.
 - Echo should take the first turn.
