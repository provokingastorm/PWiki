**Notes**
 - Generally, it's not recommended to put Sith Eternal Emperor on defense as he is easily countered. However, this is a good option to put him on defense in GAC.
 - Darth Malak stops Wampa from countering this team.
 - This composition allows for #AbilityBlock, #HealingImmunity and #TenacityDown when Sith Eternal Emperor calls his allies to assist.

[[Character - The Armorer|The Armorer]]
[[Character - Shoretrooper|Shoretrooper]]

**Counters**
 - [[Squad Notes - Jedi Master Kenobi|Jedi Master Kenobi Squads]]

**Hard Counters**
 - 

**Notes**
 - Ideally, link [[Character - Commander Ahsoka Tano|Commander Ahsoka Tano]] and [[Character - General Kenobi|General Kenobi]]
 - Having two pre-taunts will prevent the JMK getting to The Armorer after JMK dispels one of the pre-taunts using his ability that calls [[Character - Commander Ahsoka Tano|Commander Ahsoka Tano]] to assist.
 - After The Armorer gets her 2rd stack of Beskar, Grand Admiral Thrawn can give The Armorer another turn for a 3rd stack of Beskar without invoking JMK's #TurnMeterPrevention because Thrawn uses a #TurnMeterSwap. 
 - Grand Admiral Thrawn needs to be 21 speed lower than The Armorer for this sequence to work.
