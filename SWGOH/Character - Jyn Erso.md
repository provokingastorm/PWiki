## Mod Notes

 - One of the few cases where a #CritChance primary stat is useful on a triangle. Landing a crit on her will have a chance to revive a random rebel ally and stun as part of her kit.
 - Potency is also good as a primary stat to land her debuffs.
 - Speed is a great primary stat to speed up the upload process.
