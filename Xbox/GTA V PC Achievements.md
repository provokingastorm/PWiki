## Money Making
In order to complete all the online achievement, you need money. Lots of it. To buy upgrades, a facility, a strong vehicle (such as the Vigilante and/or the Karuma), and special weapons. Moreover, there's an achievement for spending 8 million on cars from the original heists. There are plenty of ways to make money in GTA V. Early on, it will be difficult to earn money. There is a solo idle method involving a custom survival mission that will net you some money without actively playing. With the use of a cronus or another idle scripting method (Tiny Task, AutoHotkey, etc), you can make money over night. The best active, repeatable method to earn money is to run the Cayo Perico heist. 

### Cayo Perico Heist
The Cayo Perico heist is a 1-4 player heist hosted on a remote island. The value of this heist is that fact that you can perform this heist by yourself. However, having 1 or 2 friends join can net you more money. From my experience, having 4 players is inefficient as the secondary loot each player collects will reduce in value. That said, you cannot start participating in the Cayo Perico heist until you own a Kosatka. The Kosatka is a personal submarine that serves as your base of operations. It doubles as a possible infiltration method for the heist. There are additional benefits to owning a Kosatka, such as being able to request a Dinghy (motorized raft) and light helicopter (called the "Sparrow"). The Sparrow will cost extra to upgrade. Money well spent, in my opinion. Something else you should keep in mind is that there is a 2.5 hour cooldown for the heist. Ideally, you would work on other money making endeavours in GTA V in between Cayo Perico heist runs. 

**Cayo Perico Solo Method Notes**
The value of the Cayo Perico heist is really in the ability to run it solo. There's nothing worse that being short 1 heist member to run a heist mission. Plus, you get to keep all the winnings from running it solo. There are tons of tricks to shorten the time it tastes to complete the heist as well as improving the success rate of your runs. The following guide will give you a good understanding of how to perform the heist solo.

### Useful Weapons
GTA V has a plethora of weapons to chose from. Of course, pick whatever weapons work for you. However, I don't recommend buying every single weapon. When you're a firefight against a bunch of enemies, nothing is more frustrating that having to cycle through a bunch of weapons to get to a weapon you need for the current situation. The time it takes to switch weapons could be life or death, especially in situations where cover is minimal to non-existent. If you already own a lot of weapons or just feel like collecting them, I suggest buying a weapons locker in one your businesses. You can use it to hide weapons for the weapon selection wheel. Here are a list of weapons that are useful for the heists in alphabetical order:


**AP Pistol** - This pistol is one of the most effective weapons to shoot while inside a vehicle. The speed at which it fires will knock down enemies quicker. It does good damage to finish off enemies. Do not put a suppressor on this weapon, since it reduces the damage. Put a suppressor on different pistol if you want one. The extended magazine is crucial for this weapon to continuously shoot from your car. 

**Assault Shotgun** - Used for close-ranged combat. Besides getting standard upgrades, such as extended magazines, get the suppressor on this weapon. It's good for sections where it's beneficial to avoid detecting other enemies. It's mostly useful for the Cayo Perico heist to kill the Juggernaut without triggering the alarms. 

**Atomizer** - This is a utility weapon (pistol type) that can help dislodge stuck vehicles by applying a force to them. If you or a teammate get a mission-critical vehicle stuck, that could mean having to restart the entire mission. This can save you from restarting by dislodging the vehicle. Unfortunately, it's only available in the gun van, which has a rotating inventory on a weekly basis. 

**Combat Machine Gun (MG) Mk II** - A great, every-purpose weapon that has a good balance of speed and power. It's good for crowd control to quickly knock enemies down or get headshots. The large magazine size (assuming you upgrade it) makes it so you're not caught reloading in the middle of a firefight with a bunch of enemies. The upgrade to Mark II (Mk II) is important. You will need a weapons workshop to upgrade it or use the one in the Freakshop where Dax lives.

**Grenade Launcher** - Useful as a backup to the RPG if you run out of bullets or you don't have an obstacle-free trajectory to your target. Great for taking out land vehicles or groups of enemies clustered together. 

**Heavy Sniper Rifle Mk II** - Needs for sniping objectives. The advanced scope is a necessary upgrade for this weapon. 

**Homing Launcher (Optional)** - There will be tons of helicopters in the heists to kill. The homing launcher can take them out effectively. However, this weapon is optional as there are other choices to take out helicopters. The Railgun, if found in the gun van, is easily the best way to take out helicopters. You could also kill the pilot with a sniper rifle or even the minigun. 

**Minigun** - Incredibly useful gun at taking out many enemies in a short amount of time. Also, important for killing Juggernauts in the Doomsday heist missions. The disadvantage is that it leaves you vulnerable since you cannot use it in cover. Also, you will run slower. Unequip it when you're not actively using it. It does require you to be level 120 to purchase. 

**Railgun** - An over-powered heavy weapon that dismantle vehicles in a flash. The downside is that you can only buy this weapon from the gun van. The inventory of the gun van changes on a weekly basis. It may take you awhile to acquire it. 

**RPG** - Very effective at taking out vehicles or large clusters of enemies. Use this weapon liberally as long as your teammates aren't standing in front of you. :)

### Improving Stats

**Strength Stat**
The strength stat is easily the most important stat to max out for the heists. The strength improves your survivability. You can improve your strength by punching civilians. However, when you do that in the overworld, you will attract the police. Thus, the best way to get away with punching civilians is in the jobs. One quick way to pull this off is by creating a custom survival job following the instructions listed here:

**Flying Stat**
There are several missions in both the original heists and the Doomsday heists that require someone to pilot a helicopter or plane. Having a maxed out flying stat will improve your overall handling of planes. I'm not going to say it's absolutely critical to have the stat maxed out, but any improvement to your Doomsday success rate should be pursued. Use the following custom job to rapidly improve your flying stat:

### Idle Survival Script
A less-efficient, but effective use of time, is to run a script that will continuously replay a survival mission while you sleep, run errands, play other games, or whatever you want. Although normally you can only start playing Survival jobs when you reach level 20. However, with playlists, you can get around this requirement a lot earlier. You will need to bookmark the following job playlist on Rockstar's Social Club website after logging into your account:

Notes from Aaron:

here try that AHK thing
of the like 2/3 W + enter shit then 28 minute loop of space spam
the survival is 25 - 26 minutes + 70 seconds loading give or take
that should be a relatively easy write up
maybe add a wait time between the W + enter to start like a buffer between them and a buffer for the initial load
I think a safe loop would be 29 minutes of space spam
W + enter with a delay of like 30 seconds before it, W + enter with another 30 second delay, enter with a 15 second delay
then a loop of spce spam for 29 straight minutes, it's super safe
