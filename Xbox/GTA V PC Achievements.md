## Money Making
In order to complete all the online achievement, you need money. Lots of it. To buy upgrades, a facility, a strong vehicle (such as the Vigilante and/or the Karuma), and special weapons. There are plenty of ways to make money in GTA V. Early on, it will be difficult to earn money. There is a solo idle method involving a custom survival mission that will net you some money without actively playing. With the use of a cronus or another idle scripting method, you can make money over night. The best active, repeatable method to earn money is to run the Cayo Perico heist. 

### Cayo Perico Heist
The Cayo Perico heist is a 1-4 player heist hosted on a remote island. The value of this heist is that fact that you can perform this heist by yourself. However, having 1 or 2 friends join can net you more money. From my experience, having 4 players is inefficient as the secondary loot each player collects will reduce in value. That said, you cannot start participating in the Cayo Perico heist until you own a Kosatka. The Kosatka is a personal submarine that serves as your base of operations. It doubles as a possible infiltration method for the heist. There are additional benefits to owning a Kosatka, such as being able to request a Dinghy (motorized raft) and light helicopter (called the "Sparrow"). The Sparrow will cost extra to upgrade. Money well spent, in my opinion. Something else you should keep in mind is that there is a 2.5 hour cooldown for the heist. Ideally, you would work on other money making endeavours in GTA V in between Cayo Perico heist runs. 

**Cayo Perico Solo Method Notes**
The value of the Cayo Perico heist is really in the ability to run it solo. There's nothing worse that being short 1 heist member to run a heist mission. Plus, you get to keep all the winnings from running it solo. There are tons of tricks to shorten the time it tastes to complete the heist as well as improving the success rate of your runs. The following guide will give you a good understanding of how to perform the heist solo.

### Idle Survival Script
A less-efficient, but effective use of time, is to run a script that will continuously replay a survival mission while you sleep, run errands, play other games, or whatever you want. Although normally you can only start playing Survival jobs when you reach level 20. However, with playlists, you can get around this requirement a lot earlier. You will need to bookmark the following job playlist on Rockstar's Social Club website after logging into your account:

Notes from Aaron:

here try that AHK thing
of the like 2/3 W + enter shit then 28 minute loop of space spam
the survival is 25 - 26 minutes + 70 seconds loading give or take
that should be a relatively easy write up
maybe add a wait time between the W + enter to start like a buffer between them and a buffer for the initial load
I think a safe loop would be 29 minutes of space spam
W + enter with a delay of like 30 seconds before it, W + enter with another 30 second delay, enter with a 15 second delay
then a loop of spce spam for 29 straight minutes, it's super safe
