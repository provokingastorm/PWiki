## 10K Kill Boosting Method

### Action Plan
Here's the boosting plan for The Big Grind(tm):

The order for the Boomshot/Torque Bow kills plus the partner grouping is completely based off the Wheel Picker website I used originally to generate turn order and teams. Based on the results, these are the pairings:

Spiderman Noire & Xx80sRockerxX
Avoling & peeeeeeeete
hatezerothree/SPNKr & ElusiveEagle

This means, Spiderman/Rocker's team goes first until they both get the Boomshot & Torque Bow kills. Again, with SPNKr only playing on Wednesdays, the SPNKr/Eagle team will do Boomshot & Torque Bow kills on those days until they're done. 

In the event that your boosting partner can't make it, I ask that you double box in his place. For example, in this first session, hate will be gone, so if Eagle can double box, that's be great. If someone can't double box Gears, we will shuffle the teams. But I'd prefer to be fair and consistent with the teams where possible to avoid confusion. 

One more thing regarding double boxers. As mentioned previously, it's up to the grenade taggers to make sure the final kill goes to the proper team to keep the match going as long as possible. It will be difficult for a double boxer to manage that, so the other team of grenade taggers will handle the final chainsaw kill. 

Let me know if I missed anything or if you have a better plan. 
### Notes From Das Chocobo
After you get all achievements besides the 10k kills/and probably the host matches one, you go to the subway map, which I believe is called War Machine. 

There are two grenades, and then a boomshot. 

Two people on opposite teams go to each location. Doesn't matter who gets there first, but when both are close enough you tag the other player with the grenade or the boomshot shoots down at the ground. 

It counts as a kill for each person. 

The hard part is making the matches last as long as possible. The people tagging each other go last typically, so whoever needs to win the round to keep the match going needs to get tagged and then chainsaw the other person who tags them.

That sounds confusing but once you see how it works it's super easy.

Oh, the boomshot sometimes spawns a torque bow, same thing tho, stand close and shoot the other player not in the head and blow up together
