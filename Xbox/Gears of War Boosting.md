## 10K Kill Boosting Method
After you get all achievements besides the 10k kills/and probably the host matches one, you go to the subway map, which I believe is called War Machine. 

There are two grenades, and then a boomshot. 

Two people on opposite teams go to each location. Doesn't matter who gets there first, but when both are close enough you tag the other player with the grenade or the boomshot shoots down at the ground. 

It counts as a kill for each person. 

The hard part is making the matches last as long as possible. The people tagging each other go last typically, so whoever needs to win the round to keep the match going needs to get tagged and then chainsaw the other person who tags them.

That sounds confusing but once you see how it works it's super easy.

Oh, the boomshot sometimes spawns a torque bow, same thing tho, stand close and shoot the other player not in the head and blow up together
