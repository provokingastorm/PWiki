## Best Class Choices

### **Seraphim**

- **Why they're great:** Highly durable, versatile in melee and magic, beginner-friendly, and can lean into powerful "BFG" gun builds.
    
    - Known as "ideal all‑around" with strong buffs and defensive capabilities [sacredwiki.darkmatters.org](https://www.sacredwiki.darkmatters.org/index.php/Sacred_2%3ACharacter_Class?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
    - The BFG build can make your Seraphim nearly immortal—with high reflection, evasion, shield absorption, and damage mitigation [sacredwiki.org](https://sacredwiki.org/index.php/Sacred_2%3AA_Comprehensive_Guide_to_the_BFG_Seraphim?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[sacredwiki.org](https://www.sacredwiki.org/index.php/Sacred_2%3AA_Comprehensive_Guide_to_the_BFG_Seraphim?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
- **Pros:** Survivability, adaptability, forgiving for new players.
    

### **Shadow Warrior**

- **Why they're strong:** A well-rounded melee powerhouse with summons, buffs, stealth—and high offensive potential.
    
    - Frequently recommended for beginners for its robustness and melee-focused play [sacredwiki.darkmatters.org](https://www.sacredwiki.darkmatters.org/index.php/Sacred_2%3ACharacter_Class?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/938603-sacred-2-fallen-angel/49631715?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
    - Community members praise its diversity: “Shadow Warrior seems most powerful,” and “simple to build” [darkmatters.org+1](https://darkmatters.org/forums/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F19261-best-overall-character-in-sacred-2%2F=&utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
- **Pros:** Flexibility, offensive power, survivability.
    

### **Dryad**

- **Why they’re fun:** Ranged/nature caster hybrid with unique mechanics—fast leveling builds exist.
    
    - A popular “Voodoo Dryad” build offers one of the fastest routes from level 1 to 100 [sacredwiki.darkmatters.org](https://sacredwiki.darkmatters.org/index.php/Sacred_2%3AVoodoo_Dryad_%28black_magic_woman%29%2C_1-100_in_20_hours_or_less%28fast_leveling_shopper%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
- **Pros:** Ranged combat, crowd control, efficient progression.
    

### **High Elf (Mage)**

- **Why choose them:** Classic mage—elemental magic user with strong offense and respectable defense options.
    
    - Offers elemental versatility (fire, ice, lightning) depending on your chosen aspect [PlayStation Trophies](https://www.playstationtrophies.org/forum/topic/14842-a-beginners-guide-to-sacred-2-for-ps3-users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        

### **Temple Guardian & Inquisitor**

- **Temple Guardian:** Powerful and often cited as “most powerful overall” [darkmatters.org](https://darkmatters.org/forums/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F19261-best-overall-character-in-sacred-2%2F=&utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Inquisitor:** Great for magic/melee hybrids; sometimes favorite class overall for interesting gameplay [darkmatters.org](https://darkmatters.org/forums/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F19261-best-overall-character-in-sacred-2%2F=&utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

### **Dragon Mage** (Ice & Blood expansion)

- **Why they stand out:** Added later, offers transformation and draconic magic, adding flavor and versatility [Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_2%3A_Fallen_Angel?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Best God (Deity) Choices

- **Testa** – A powerful choice for most classes (except Seraphim). Provides both offensive damage and healing support, scaling well with **Divine Devotion** [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/949630-sacred-2-fallen-angel/61234115?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Forens or Lumen** – These are better for Seraphim. The healing from Kybele is less effective late-game, making Forens (or Lumen, if you invest in Divine Devotion) smarter picks [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/949630-sacred-2-fallen-angel/61234115?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Kuan** – Good for melee classes like Inquisitors, thanks to Kuan's Breath (confusion/nuke potential) [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/949630-sacred-2-fallen-angel/61234115?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

> _Note:_ Seraphim **cannot** choose dark gods. Similarly, Inquisitor is limited to certain paths [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/949630-sacred-2-fallen-angel/61234115?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Final Take

- **Easiest all‑around**: **Seraphim** with a BFG or defensive build and pick **Forens** (or Lumen) if you’re on the Light path.
    
- **Most fun and flexible**: **Shadow Warrior**, pick **Testa** for mixed power or **Kuan** for chaos melee domination.
    
- **Fastest leveling**: Go the **Dryad** route.
    
- **Uniquely cool**: Try **High Elf**, **Temple Guardian**, or the **Dragon Mage** (if you have the expansion).
