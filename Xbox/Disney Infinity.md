### Base

Disney Infinity Bases are compatible with all editions of Disney Infinity. Note: the Xbox 360 and Xbox ONE bases are only compatible with their respective platforms.

### Figures

Figures are forward-compatible in the Toy Box mode. Use your Figures from Disney Infinity and Disney Infinity 2.0 in the Disney Infinity 3.0 Toy Box. However, new Figures from Disney Infinity 3.0 cannot be used in Disney Infinity and Disney Infinity 2.0.​

Figures released with a corresponding Play Set can enter than story, but all characters can be played in the Toy Box. For instance, only Sulley, Mike, and Randy can play in the Monsters University Play Set.

Some Figures will have the ability to cross over into other Play Sets of the same universe, but you will first need to find their matching [crossover coins](https://appsupport.disney.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000795483).

Power Discs are forward-compatible in Toy Box mode. For instance, Power Discs from Disney Infinity and Disney Infinity 2.0 can be used in the Disney Infinity 3.0 Toy Box. However, new Power Discs from Disney Infinity 3.0 cannot be used in Disney Infinity and Disney Infinity 2.0.

### Play Sets

Disney Infinity Play Sets will only work with the Disney Infinity edition that they were created for. For instance, Disney Infinity and Disney Infinity 2.0 Play Sets will not work with Disney Infinity 3.0; however, all Play Set Pieces will unlock all associated Play Set Toys for use within the Disney Infinity 3.0 Toy Box.
