That‚Äôs a really good question üëç ‚Äî since **DirectX9 is ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù** and Windows 11 is modern, you can definitely hit some snags. Here are the **most common issues people run into when creating DirectX games on Windows 11**:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 1. **DirectX 9 SDK Compatibility**

- The **DirectX SDK (June 2010)** is required for D3DX9, but it‚Äôs old.
    
- On Windows 11, the installer sometimes fails or warns about **‚ÄúS1023 error‚Äù** (conflict with newer Visual C++ redistributables).
    
    - ‚úÖ Fix: uninstall or update conflicting VC++ runtimes, install the SDK, then reinstall newer runtimes if needed.
        

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. **Missing D3DX9 Libraries**

- Modern Windows SDKs **don‚Äôt include D3DX9** headers or libs.
    
- If you only install the modern Windows SDK, you‚Äôll see errors like:
    
    ```
    fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'd3dx9.h'
    ```
    
    - ‚úÖ Fix: always install the legacy DX9 SDK and point your project‚Äôs **Include** and **Library** directories to it.
        

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. **32-bit vs. 64-bit Confusion**

- By default, a lot of DX9 examples assume **x86 (32-bit)** builds.
    
- If you try compiling for **x64**, you must link against the `Lib\x64` versions.
    
    - ‚úÖ Fix: make sure your project‚Äôs **Platform Toolset** matches the library path (`Lib\x86` vs `Lib\x64`).
        

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. **Graphics Driver Issues**

- Some modern GPUs (especially Intel integrated or laptops with hybrid graphics) don‚Äôt always behave well with legacy APIs.
    
- Issues include:
    
    - Device creation failing (`D3DERR_INVALIDCALL`).
        
    - Rendering glitches or crashes.
        
    - Frame rate throttling under modern Windows compositors.
        
    - ‚úÖ Fix: force use of **hardware device (HAL)** and check `CreateDevice` return values. Keep a **software fallback** (`REF`) for debugging.
        

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. **High DPI / Window Scaling**

- Windows 11 uses **DPI scaling** by default (125%, 150% on high-res displays).
    
- Old DX9 code that assumes 1:1 pixel mapping may render stretched, blurred, or offset.
    
    - ‚úÖ Fix: declare your app as **DPI-aware** in the manifest, or adjust viewport/scissor rects based on actual window size.
        

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 6. **Debugging Tools Are Obsolete**

- PIX for DirectX9 (included in SDK) is outdated and won‚Äôt run on Win11.
    
- RenderDoc has **limited DX9 support**.
    
- Debugging graphics can be painful without modern tooling.
    
    - ‚úÖ Fix: rely on **DirectX debug runtimes** (installed with the DX9 SDK) and verbose error logging (`D3DERR_` messages).
        

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 7. **Gamepad/Input Issues**

- Old DX9 games often use **DirectInput** (deprecated).
    
- On Windows 11, Xbox controllers and many gamepads only expose **XInput**.
    
    - ‚úÖ Fix: use **XInput** (modern API) instead of DirectInput for controllers.
        

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 8. **Full-Screen Exclusive Mode Problems**

- DirectX9 apps often use exclusive full-screen, which can conflict with Windows 11‚Äôs **Desktop Window Manager (DWM)**.
    
- Symptoms:
    
    - Alt+Tab crashes.
        
    - Flickering on multi-monitor setups.
        
    - V-Sync behaving inconsistently.
        
    - ‚úÖ Fix: consider **borderless windowed mode** instead of exclusive full-screen for stability.
        

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 9. **Shader Model Support**

- DX9 supports up to **Shader Model 3.0**.
    
- On modern compilers/GPUs, some HLSL profiles (`ps_2_0`, `vs_1_1`) may not compile or run correctly.
    
    - ‚úÖ Fix: stick to **SM 3.0 (ps_3_0 / vs_3_0)**, which is universally supported.
        

---

‚úÖ In summary:  
The **biggest headaches** on Windows 11 are:

1. Installing and configuring the **DirectX 9 SDK** properly.
    
2. Handling **driver quirks and scaling issues**.
    
3. Working without modern debug tools.

üëâ Do you want me to also put together a **troubleshooting checklist** (step-by-step fixes for when your DX9 project won‚Äôt run on Win11), so you can refer to it whenever things break?
